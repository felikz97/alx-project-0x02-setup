# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

##  Project Description
This project is a comprehensive introduction to setting up and working with Next.js, 
TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It guides you through creating a modern web 
application with reusable components, routing, API integration, and proper 
project structure. The project covers fundamental concepts from initial 
setup to building interactive components and fetching data from external APIs.

## Learning Objectives
### By completing this project, you will:

* Understand how to scaffold a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
* Learn to implement basic routing in Next.js using the Pages Router
* Create reusable components with TypeScript interfaces
* Implement interactive UI elements like modals and buttons
* Fetch and display data from external APIs
* Structure a Next.js project following best practices
* Work with component props and state management

* Code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Implementation Guide
* Start by setting up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
* Implement basic routing with the Pages Router
* Build reusable components one by one, starting with simple ones (Card, Button)
* Progress to more complex components (Modal, PostCard, UserCard)
* Implement the Header component for navigation
* Fetch and display data from JSONPlaceholder API
* Test each component and page as you build them

## Expected Outcomes
* A fully functional Next.js application
